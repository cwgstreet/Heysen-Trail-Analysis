# Heysen-Trail-Analysis
Python learning project - web data scraping, pandas, data analysis, graphs and plotting


## Background
In 2019, I completed a 51-day end-to-end (thru-hike) of South Australia's 1,200km Heysen Trail.  A daily trail journal, pics and GPS tracking data can be found at my user page at [ramblr.com](user.ramblr.com/gstreet).  I've intended to write a final wrap-up blog that includes analysis of my daily thru-hike performance.

I've also been wanting to start learning Python for some time, so I decided to make a learning project based around analysing my trail journal data.  

## Python learning elements

* general python coding & structure
* web data scraping, including using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
* reading and writing csv files
* regular expression (re) matching
* Pandas data frames (loading, data validation and clean-up, )
* data analysis
* graphical display of data analysis
